# Applied Statistics Tasks Repository

Welcome to my Applied Statistics repository! 📊  
This repo contains a collection of completed applied statistics exercises and experiments, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb).  

Each notebook is self-contained; imports are provided inline, and main libraries are also listed in requirements.txt.

## 📑 Task Overview  

| Notebook | Topic | Key Concepts | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------------|-------|
| AS1_AB.ipynb | 🧪 A/B Testing Basics | Hypothesis testing, α & β errors, statistical power | Conducted A/B test experiments, visualized histograms, and explored Type I/II errors, alpha/beta trade-offs, and the foundations of statistical testing. |
| AS2_Parametric_Tests.ipynb | 🧑🏻‍💻 Parametric Tests | Simpsons's Paradox, A/B simulation biases | Explored the essence of Simpson's and "Stop the Count" Paradoxes, conducted A/B and A/A simulations, generated and visualized data. |
| AS3_Probability_Tests.ipynb | 🔬 Probability Tests | Two-Sample Independent and Paired T-tests | Conducted experiments with the data on students' exam performance, exploring the difference in application of an independent and paired t-tests. |
| AS4_Nonparametric.ipynb | 📚 Nonparametric Tests | Mann-Whitney U-Test & Permutation Test | "Crashed" the Mann-Whitney test, comparing it to the power of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; implemented a two-sided permutation (random) test. |
| AS6_Bootstrap.ipynb | 🧩 Resampling & Robust Inference | Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (Percentile, Hall, t-Bootstrap, Double Bootstrap) | Implemented multiple bootstrap CI methods for median differences (Verizon–CLEC repair times); analyzed asymmetry effects, demonstrated robustness of t-bootstrap, and detected systematic discrimination in service times. |

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation  

To run the notebooks locally, you’ll need Python 3.8+ and the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/applied-statistics-tasks.git
cd applied-statistics-tasks
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, open directly in Google Colab.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage  

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:  

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the notebook of interest (e.g., `AS1_AB.ipynb`).  
3. Run cells step by step to explore code, results, and commentary.

## 📊 Results & Visualizations  

Each notebook includes:  
 • Explanations of the approach  
 • Evaluation metrics and hypothesis test results  
 • Key visualizations (histograms, distributions, error regions)  
 • Reflections on results and limitations  

---

## 🛠 Dependencies  

Main libraries used across notebooks:  
 • NumPy, Pandas  
 • Matplotlib, Seaborn  
 • SciPy, statsmodels  

See requirements.txt for the full list.

## 🌟 Future Work  

Planned extensions:  
 • Additional hypothesis testing case studies  
 • Bayesian approaches to A/B testing  
 • Resampling methods (bootstrap, permutation tests)  
 • Real-world applications (marketing, healthcare, product experiments)
